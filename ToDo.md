- Add a new RoslynTool that can get type documentation from an unqualified type name given the solution path, filename, and type name
- This will determine the fully qualified type name given the context of the .cs file.
- Then it can just call GetTypeDocumentation on the fully qualfied type name and return that information
- Write the unit tests to test this new functionality
