✅ Get docs here:
https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk

✅ Update TestApp client usage
✅ Follow their example for creating, and using a client, but use the SseClientTransport instead.  Use Context7

## Completed Tasks:
- Updated TestApp to use proper MCP client with SseClientTransport
- Client now follows the official MCP SDK patterns from QuickstartClient example
- Client connects to server, discovers tools, and calls them using proper MCP protocol
- Both projects use ModelContextProtocol packages v0.2.0-preview.1
- All components properly integrated with Serilog logging
